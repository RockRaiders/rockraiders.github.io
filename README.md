### This is the root of the public site please commit carefully!!!

All development should proceed in the develop branch until it is deemed appropriate to pull into the production branch.
New pages should be completed in their own branch off the current develop.

1. Please follow the current project structure as defined in the various README's (if you have any suggestions for
improvements feel free to run them by me)
2. This site is built using mobile-first design.  Primarily, this means that CSS should be written such that outer
level styles specify the style for mobile, and media queries with (min-width:) should be used to add/modify styles
for a tablet/desktop environment.
3. Chrome is the primary development browser and Firefox should be also be supported
