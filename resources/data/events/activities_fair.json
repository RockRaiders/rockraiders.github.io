Get a feel for who we are as a team and the kinds of experiences Rock Raiders can offer.  Representatives from all four of our specialized subteams (Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Science) will be there to engage you with whatever interest you may have.  We are trying to plan in live demonstration of our teleoperation capabilities with our software/electrical testbed, and the new rover chassis will be on display.  Can't make it?  Join us for our <a href='/pages/event_detail.html?event=gbm_1'>first general body meeting</a> the next day."
