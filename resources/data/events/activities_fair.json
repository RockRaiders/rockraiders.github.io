Get a feel for who we really are as a team and the kinds of experiences Rock Raiders can offer.  Representatives from all four of our specialized subteams (Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and Science) will be there to engage you with whatever interest you may have.  You'll also get to take a look the body of the rover we will be fleshing out in the coming year.  Finally, you can sign up for our mailing list right there to receive timely updates about our meetings and events."
